# Biomass: BECCS and Biochar
This blog post is an overview of what I learned from [Module 4 of Carbon Removal Academy](http://climatechangeacademy.com/courses/carbon-removal/4) while going through the [AirMiners BootUp program](https://bootup.airminers.org/).

# Overview
Bio-energy Carbon Capture & Storage (BECCS) is the process of using biological product (plants, wood, etc) as an energy source & storing the resulting CO2 underground. There are several byproducts produced during this process. Biochar which is a charcoal-like material that has a variety of applications. 

I feel as if I finished this week not fully understanding the potential of BECCS. I started this week very skeptical of its ability to be scaled up *equitably* and finished feeling like "hmmm maybe it is a solution, at least in the US". This might just be a lack of knowledge on BECCS Capability in other nations. 

- Pros:
- This could turn biowaste into a useful CDR tool. 
- Biochar can improve soil health 
-

- Con:
- Fossil Fuel industry is a big fan of injecting carbon underground because it enables whats known as "enhanced oil recovery"
- Growing crops exclusively for BECCS seems like a wasteful use of land. 
- Transporting biomass to an injection site costs its own set of emissions
- Even when storing CO2 underground it still tries/wants to escape

# Notes
These are notes & highlights taken during my study. Should be noted that some of these bullet points might be copy/pasted from the articles themselves. 

- BECCS involves growing plants, absorbing CO2 in the process, then converting the resulting biomass into energy. The carbon emissions are captured and buried underground, both removing CO2 the atmosphere and producing energy at the same time.

- Areas where large volumes of biomass can be grown and CO2 can be stored do not necessarily overlap.

- Research finds that there are enough suitable areas of the US to remove around 110m-120m tonnes (Mt) CO2 from the atmosphere by 2020 and 360-630MtCO2 by 2040.

- The US is of particular interest for the initial development and deployment of BECCS because it has relatively high biomass productivity and well-mapped geologic storage sites for CO2. The US also has a relatively mature bioenergy industry, as well as a number of pilot scale CO2 injection projects.
    - The US has a huge CO2 storage potential, with a total storage capacity estimated at around 3,000,000MtCO2. These storage sites are concentrated in the Southern, Northeastern, and Central Western parts of the country.
