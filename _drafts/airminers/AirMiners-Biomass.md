# Biomass: BECCS and Biochar
This blog post is an overview of what I learned from [Module 4 of Carbon Removal Academy](http://climatechangeacademy.com/courses/carbon-removal/4) while going through the [AirMiners BootUp program](https://bootup.airminers.org/).

# Overview

# Notes
These are notes & highlights taken during my study. Should be noted that some of these bullet points might be copy/pasted from the articles themselves. 

- BECCS involves growing plants, absorbing CO2 in the process, then converting the resulting biomass into energy. The carbon emissions are captured and buried underground, both removing CO2 the atmosphere and producing energy at the same time.

- Areas where large volumes of biomass can be grown and CO2 can be stored do not necessarily overlap.

- Research finds that there are enough suitable areas of the US to remove around 110m-120m tonnes (Mt) CO2 from the atmosphere by 2020 and 360-630MtCO2 by 2040.

- The US is of particular interest for the initial development and deployment of BECCS because it has relatively high biomass productivity and well-mapped geologic storage sites for CO2. The US also has a relatively mature bioenergy industry, as well as a number of pilot scale CO2 injection projects.
    - The US has a huge CO2 storage potential, with a total storage capacity estimated at around 3,000,000MtCO2. These storage sites are concentrated in the Southern, Northeastern, and Central Western parts of the country.
