# Notes
These are notes & highlights taken during my study. Should be noted that some of these bullet points might be copy/pasted from the articles themselves. 
- We have a LOT of geological storage capability as mentioned in DAC
- Mineralization is a well understood process & there is a lot of rock
    - most of it (basalt) is underwater & hard to reach
- Long term site management is an issue.
    - Luckily we know permance is not a problem, but we need to still ensure the site will be taken care of. 
    - In sites where CO2 is converted into a rock its likely we dont need long term management.
