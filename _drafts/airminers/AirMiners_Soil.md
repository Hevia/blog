# Soil

This blog post is an overview of what I learned from [Module 2 of Carbon Removal Academy]() while going through the [AirMiners BootUp program]().

# Overview


# Notes
- Regenerative agriculture are a group of practices aimed at promoting soil health by restoring soil's organic carbon (SOC) levels 

- No-till reduces soil erosion and encourages water to penerate soils. 
    - Downsides being it might require more herbicide usage on its own

- Diverse crop rotations can lower pesticide use.
- Cover crops provide many of the same benefits as No-till and can reduce water runoff/pollution.

- For carbon to remain in soils over the long term it must first be converted into microbial organic matter. 
    - This requires around one ton of nitrogen for every 12 tons of carbon sequestered. 

- Cover crops have a sequesteration potential of 100 million tons if planted on just 85% of annually planted cropland. 

- Agroforestery has a high startup cost. Waiting for trees to grow. This is land & money lost to the farmer.
    - This could be mitigated through a variety of economic incentive strategies that pay the farmer to take care of the developing trees.

- Arabidopsis, a small flowering plant widely used as a model organism in plant biology.

- Topsoil accounts for the first 15cm of soil. 

- You can detect surface-level soil carbon through remote sensing methods.
    - This is the approach taken by Regen Network.
    - They use the Sentinel-2's Sat bands 2, 3, 4.

- The average carbon intake levels of all cultivated soil measured on Earth is 1%
    - If all cultivated land on Earth (3.6 billion acres?) could intake just 3% of carbon, that would equate to nearly a trillion tons of CO2

- We should model our farms after the native ecosystems of the area. They don't lose soil, build organic matter, fertilizes itself, doesn't run on fossil fuels. 
- Crops that need to be re-planted annually account for 70% of food consumed globally.
    - Majority being rice, corn, wheat, and soy
    - Annual crops have less carbon sequesteration potential 
    - We can replace these annual crops with perennial analogs through selective breeding, gene editing, etc

- Suberin is a compond in plants that absorbs carbon & resists decomposition. 
    - This enables plants to be better sources of long term carbon storage

- By 2050 the global population is likely to be 10 billion.

- Crop insurance reform is a good avenuve to encourage regen ag practices.
    - The program is administered through Federal Crop Insurance Corporation (FCIC), a wholly owned government corporation managed by the Risk Management Agency (RMA), an arm of the USDA.

- A Rodale Institute farm trial found that corn grown organically with cover crops produced 28-34% higher yields than conventional corn in drought years.
