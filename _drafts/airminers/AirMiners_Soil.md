# Soil

This blog post is an overview of what I learned from [Module 2 of Carbon Removal Academy]() while going through the [AirMiners BootUp program]().

# Notes

- The average carbon intake levels of all cultivated soil measured on Earth is 1%
    - If all cultivated land on Earth (3.6 billion acres?) could intake just 3% of carbon, that would equate to nearly a trillion tons of CO2
