# Intro
I recently stumbled upon a neat scientific search engine called [Consensus](https://consensus.app/) (still in beta as of writing!). I tried a few toy searches, was impressed by the results. I am building a similar search engine, but for specifically climate/conservation science over at ClimateScholar. I'd like to think I am somewhat up to date on AI for scientific search. So their relevant search results got me wondering, how is the team serving up such good answers? A few possibilities: 

1. Their data source is narrow in scope & curated. (It is still huge, but narrow compared to web-scale ala Google)
2. Their AI retriever is pretty darn solid.

However! Even with their curated set of data
