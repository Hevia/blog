# Debunking Flawed Climate models by Hoover Institution


# Examining our source
Before diving into the article let us take a look at exactly *who* are making these claims. This is not a section to belittle the authors, but if you denying climate change you likely have an incentive to do so. It would help to recognize that bias before moving on to the article.

## Who is the Hoover Institution?

## Who is David R Henderson?

## Who is Charles L Hooper?

## When was this published?

## What is my bias?
It is only fair to discuss my own bias. As of writing this (October 2021) I don't work in the climate space nor do I have any investments in any specific climate companies. I work for Microsoft, but not for anything climate related with the company. I volunteer my time to my local 350 org (a climate activist group) & to I volunteer my development skills to various climate related projects. 

I have a personal stake in the climate crisis in that I love the outdoors, I would like to see it protected & still around for myself & others to enjoy. I grew up in Florida, I know what unbearable heat feels like that. I do not want that to be my (or others) new normal.
