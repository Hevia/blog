# Introduction üß™
This post is a sort of informal literature review of scientific claim verification & generation. As of spring 2022, I am looking to start a graduate program. In preparation for that I am trying to narrow down my research interests to the general umbrella of scientific NLP. I'll be writing a series of posts outlining these tasks in the hope I can educate others & narrow down my research goals. ü§ó

Scientific claim verification is a new NLP task introduced in (cite). The goal of the task is given a scientific claim & associated abstract(s). Identify whether or not the claim is supported or refuted by the abstract(s) and extract rationale sentences that justify the conclusion. 

From my understanding, one of the motivations behind this task is to aid researchers sift through scientific claims easily. This is as opposed to fact checking where the goal is to aid platforms & journalists in countering misinformation. Both of these tasks are similar in the sense they are determing whether an input claim is supported or refuted by a set of given source documents & models need to explain their rationale for their choices. In actuality you can likely also use models trained on scientific claims in efforts to combat misinformation. The reason for this distinction is to limit what the scope of the dataset is covering. 

Where these two tasks diverge is the nature of their inputs. For scientific claim verification, a valid claim is defined as: fluent, atomic, & decontextualized. While for fact checking the input does not have these restrictions. Let's explore some examples of valid claims!

| Type      | Example |
| ----------- | ----------- |
| Atomic      | Dogs are mammals. |
| Not Atomic   | Dogs are mammals and have four legs. |  


| Type      | Example |
| ----------- | ----------- |
| Decontextualized      | Earthquakes happen because of the movement of tectonic plates. |
| Not Decontextualized   | As per the sentence previous, we know what causes earthquakes to happen. |

- Taking existing sentences and augmenting them into a valid claim. (T)
- Using retrival augmented transofmers (RAG, RETRO, WebGPT). This could be immensely useful to keep the model updated over time as scientific claims change.
- Deploying tools that use these models to observe how researchers use it.
