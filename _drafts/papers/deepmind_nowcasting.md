# Skilful precipitation nowcasting using deep generative models of radar

## What
DeepMind trained a Deep Generative Model on radar observations in the hopes of creating a model 


## Why
Nowcasting (the act of predicting the weather in the next hour or so) is an extremely important task for a variety of fields.(Sports, transportation, news) Accurate weather predictions can improve safety, increase quality of life, and optimize logistical decisions. Current weather prediction systems have a long compute times & struggle with accurate predictions within 2-hours from a given point in time. Machine Learning methods can fill in this gap and provide quick weather forecasts for the immediate future.

## How

## Key Findings

## My perspective

This is my first time attempting to summarize a paper in this field. So I'l; save you my opinion until its informed by more papers & model building experience. :)
