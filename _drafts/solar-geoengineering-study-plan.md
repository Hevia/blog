# Introduction ‚òÄÔ∏è
After going through the [AirMiners BootUp program](https://bootup.airminers.org/) (which is a curated learning path you do along with a cohort of other people over the course of 5 weeks, highly reccommended!). I wished something existed for Solar Geoengineering so I decided to try come up with a plan myself :). P.S: I learned a LOT going through the Airminers material, you can find all my notes [here.](https://hevia.github.io/blog/categories/#airminers)

The plan follows the exact pattern of(Carbon Removal Academy](http://climatechangeacademy.com/courses/carbon-removal). We start with an overview of the space, then each module focuses on a specific technique/topic. Within each module there are 3 tracks. 

- High Flyer : Gives a big picture overview of the module.
- Solar Student : Material that digs deeper into the topic but doesn't require specific technical requirements.
- Solar Master : This material is more technical & meant to help you better understand implementation details.

After the failure of COP26 to produce a plan that will keep the Earth from warming below 1.5 degrees. I've become more convinced that we *might* need to one day rely on solar geoengineering techniques to help mitiage some of the worse effects of the climate crisis or to buy us time for gobal society to fully decarbonize. There are a LOT of unknowns involved with geoengineering & it is important we begin to fill in the gaps of our knowledge before the time comes to rely on these methods.

I'm hoping this study plan can get more people interested in this field & begin thinking about this problem. 

I'll update this post as I find better material/make any changes.
