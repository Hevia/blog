# Overview
Scott Young's Ultralearning is an odd book, it strikes this annoying balance of being too little & too much information at the same time, but this blog post isn't a review. Just me documenting some of the important things I grasped from reading it.

If you enjoy learning as a hobby, (or want to learn a new skill for your career) I do reccommend the book. It can bog you down with examples at times, but it is a short read for (potentially) big gains. I mainly wrote this post to write out my own personal notes I took while reading the book. It is far easier to reference a post then have to thumb through my notes whenever I need to recall specifics.

While none of the specific advice is groundbreaking, the way you put it into practice is extremely helpful for those who care to establish meaningful learning habits post schooling. While Scott says you could use these principles in parallel with your classes I found them to be redundant considering coursework provides much of the structure already.


# Ultralearning Princples 
1. Metalearning - This encapsulates learning how to learn & meta details about your project. Develop a plan for how you'll learn what you're learning. Make a specific & well defined goal for the outcome you want. (and when you want to achieve it)

2. Focus - Carve out time in your calender to dedicate on this project. This ensures a minimum time committment each week. 

3. Directness - You should be deliberately practicing the skill you aim to learn, early & often. (I.e: Want to learn to code? Write code.)

4. Drill - Practice specific subskills, focus on improving what you think is missing. (I.e: For programming, this might be practicing leetcode or making websites. You can narrow it down as much as you see fit.)

5. Retrieval - Don't rely on your notes all the time. Put yourself in situations where you have to activelly recall the information. (Anki works great for this & retention.)

6. Feedback - Quiz yourself. For an academic subject this could quite literally be tests or quizzes. For a physical sport this might be competing 

7. Retention - Develop systems that ensure long term retention of the information. Scott details a few methods, but I found [Anki]() to be the best here. 

8. Intution - Knowning when you have "intution" on a subject can be difficult to gauge, but a good way to build intution is to confirm you know the material. Scott reccomends the Feynman technique, but I am a bigger fan of the [LPC Method]() (Feynman Technique + Feedback) described by Thomas Frank. I've found that as long as you focus on the rest of the principles, this one can be built naturally. 

9. Experimentation - Try new things with the subject you are learning. Even if you think it might not work. Incorporate "play".

# Example Setup
Goal: The "what"
Method: The "how"
Timeframe: The "when"
Why: I found listing this out helps remind me *why* I am pursing this goal during times where I could use the motivation.
