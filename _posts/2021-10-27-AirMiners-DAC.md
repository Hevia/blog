title: Direct Air Capture as a carbon removal solution [AirMiners Bootup]

# Direct Air Capture
This blog post is an overview of what I learned from [Module 5 of Carbon Removal Academy](http://climatechangeacademy.com/courses/carbon-removal/5) while going through the [AirMiners BootUp program](https://bootup.airminers.org/).

# Overview
Direct Air Caputre (DAC) is one of the sections I was most excited about. Sadly I also couldn't put as much time as I wanted to thuis

Pros:
- Permance is very high. Storing CO2 underground works very well!
- The variety of material & approaches is high. 
- Land usage effectiveness is quite good. You can sequester a lot of carbon for little land
- US has well mapped out geologic storage capacity. 

Cons:
- $ per ton is still very expensive. It will likely be some time before its brought down to the goal $100/ton
- Facilities require a high costs
    - Maintence, materials, energy usage, etc

# Notes
These are notes & highlights taken during my study. Should be noted that some of these bullet points might be copy/pasted from the articles themselves. 

- Air Contacters have to be wide to increase surface area for CO2 capture. 
- No need to build DAC systems on farmable land.
- There is an estimated several thousand gigatons of geologic storage for CO2.
- Most geologic storage is not at risk for storage.
- DAC requires a lot of energy
    - It is a big limitation currently.

- Solvents & Solid Sorbents are the two leading approaches for DAC
    - Solvents : Rely on structured packing with solvent flow over the packing.
        - Requires a strong base.
    - Solid sorbents : Rely on a honey-comb structure with chemicals bound to structure
        - Similar to the cat converter in your car
        - Requires currently expensive micro-chemical material
        - Can use a small base

- On average for 1 MtCO2 requires 300-500 MW of electricity. 
    - Most of that comes from thermal operations. 

- There is a land tradeoff with which energy source you use. 

- We've been injecting CO2 since 1972 in the permian basin
    - No accidents during that time

- The carbon density of air is far lower then the carbon density of fossil fuels.
    - Which means inserting CO2 into the ground is not a 1:1 match. We must insert more then we have emitted.

# Open Questions
- Is there any work being done in new material discovery? 
    - I'm thinking of the something similar to the work done in drug discovery, trying to use algorithims to automate the search process for new materials.
