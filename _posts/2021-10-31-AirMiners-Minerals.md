# Carbon Storage: Mineralization and Geologic Sequestration
This blog post is an overview of what I learned from [Module 6 of Carbon Removal Academy](http://climatechangeacademy.com/courses/carbon-removal/6) while going through the [AirMiners BootUp program](https://bootup.airminers.org/).

# Overview
Similar to DAC, I did not have the time this week to really dig into Mineralization. Many of the notes on geologic sequestration are similar to previous weeks though

Mineralization has a high permance capacity & can be used in conjunction with DAC, but the downside is the lack of any end product from Mineralization (although there are attempts to address this) which can hinder its ability to bring costs per ton down.

# Notes
These are notes & highlights taken during my study. Should be noted that some of these bullet points might be copy/pasted from the articles themselves. 
- We have a LOT of geological storage capability as mentioned in DAC
- Mineralization is a well understood process & there is a lot of rock
    - most of it (basalt) is underwater & hard to reach
- Long term site management is an issue.
    - Luckily we know permance is not a problem, but we need to still ensure the site will be taken care of. 
    - In sites where CO2 is converted into a rock its likely we dont need long term management. 

- According to the work done by Dr. Greg Dipple, recycling mine tailings have the potential to sequester a lot of carbon
    - Seeing as industrial waste is only going to keep growing. This is a very promising area.
