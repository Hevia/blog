# Coastal Blue Carbon and Seaweed Cultivation
This blog post is an overview of what I learned from [Module 8 of Carbon Removal Academy](http://climatechangeacademy.com/courses/carbon-removal/8) while going through the [AirMiners BootUp program](https://bootup.airminers.org/).


# Overview
This module was similar to the soil & forests modules in a lot of ways. Using a nautral solution to sequester carbon. However coastal ecosystems not only sequester magnitudes more carbon then land ecosystems, but also have far fewer cons compared to land equivalents too. Most notably is the lack of competing land prioities (you dont need to decide whether to use this land to grow food, solar, wind, biochar feedstock), lower upfront capital (unlike in the case of switching a farm over to regen ag practices), and less political barriers (its easy to convince conservatives the benefits of restoring fish/food populations, especially since these solutions are often out of site).

I won't do a pro/cons section similar to previous overviews. Partially because of a deadline to get this post out, also since it would look similar to the soil & forest modules.


# Notes
These are notes & highlights taken during my study. Should be noted that some of these bullet points might be copy/pasted from the articles themselves. 

- The three types of coastal blue carbon ecosystems are: mangroves, tidal marshes, & seagrasses.

- Mangroves provide an estimated $1.6 Billion USD in ecosystem services
    - Supporting fisheries
    - Crucial spawning grounds for commercial fish species
    - Filtering pollutants from coastal waters
    - Protect against storms. floods, & erosions 

- Running Tide is growing massive amounts of seaweed and sinking it in the deepest parts of the sea.
    - They do this to mimic the natural processes that turned ancient plants into carbon storing fossil fuels. 
    - They use biodegradable buoys & grow the seaweed in the iddle of the deep ocean
    - The process is low tech & simple enough. It can scale pretty easily.
    - R&D is still being done on the long term viability of deploying these microfarms at scale. 

- Indonesia alone cotains 22% of the worlds mangroves & 30% of global blue carbon potential
    - 40% of mangroves in the country have been lost the last 30 years 

- We can use ancient seagrass fossil DNA to determine differences in genetic diversity of seagrass over time


## Charts:
This module was chart heavy, here are some of my favoites (without much context because they explain themselves pretty well)

# Open Questions
- How is sinkig seaweed not a bad thing? It sounds great in practice but are there any long term negative consequences?
- Who manages coastal restoration projects in the US? USFS?
- How can geospatial data science help fill in the gaps for coastal restoration projects?
    - Can any sat bands measure carbon sequestration from imaging alone?
- Is there a "DroneSeed" for coastal ecosystem restoration? 
    - What I mean by this, is can you automate these ecosystem restoration process off to drones, or most of it that is?
- Can "community based ecosystem restoration? be accomplished in the states? What policy barriers prevent it?
- What is the sentiment among conservatives about coastal ecosystems? Do they like them? Why/why not?
- What is the exact permanance of these solutions? How does it differ from other carbon storage methods?
