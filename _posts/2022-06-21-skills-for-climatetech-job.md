# Overview
This was originally meant to be a more comprehensive blog post, but I decided there wasn't that interesting of an analysis to be made here. I am posting it now to share it with friends who are actively looking for jobs in this space, feel free to use this for your own benefit! The data was collected from ~Fall 2021, for Software Engineer, ML, MLOps, DevOps, Data Science, & Geospatial roles.

Roles were found on these websites:
