title: Removing carbon using our oceans ðŸŒŠ [AirMiners Bootup]

# Ocean CDR
This blog post is an overview of what I learned from [Module 9 of Carbon Removal Academy](http://climatechangeacademy.com/courses/carbon-removal/9) while going through the [AirMiners BootUp program](https://bootup.airminers.org/).

# Notes
These are notes & highlights taken during my study. Should be noted that some of these bullet points might be copy/pasted from the articles themselves. 
- Many ocean enhanced weathering methods to increase alkalinity involve increasing ocean bicarbonate
- Alkalinity differs with depth
- If we donâ€™t spread out the increasing alkalinity efforts. It could have a negative effect
- How do you measure the impact of enhanced weathering projects?
- Cyanobacteria is Earths most abundant phytoplankton
- Biological Pump - the process of organic matter that sinks to the ocean and isnâ€™t decomposed and is buried by sediment. Thus being geologically trapped.
- Iron enables phytoplankton to absorb nitrogen similar to how iron helps us absorb oxygen
- Growing coral reefs acidifies the ocean because it removes calcium carbonate from the ocean
- Warm water absorbs more CO2
- Project Vesta took the nonprofit route because it allowed better PR & ability to network with many folks in the field. Their end goal is build  pen algorithms for others to use.
    - project vestaâ€™s transportation plan seems to emit a lot on its own. Do they factor that in to their carbon sequestered

# Open Questions
- What was the SOIre experiment?
- What went wrong with the plan to fertilize the ocean with iron? How could we revisit this?
- What are electrochemical reactions?
