# Carbon Utilization
This blog post is an overview of what I learned from [Module 7 of Carbon Removal Academy](http://climatechangeacademy.com/courses/carbon-removal/7) while going through the [AirMiners BootUp program](https://bootup.airminers.org/).


# Overview
This was a module I had no clue I would enjoy so much. My initial impression was defintely in camp "dont utilize carbon, store all of it", but after seeing the breath of solutions in this space & its ability to scale rapidly (due to the fact you are producing a commoditiy). I am much more hopeful of carbon utilization as a strategy. 

Actually managed to go through all the sources for this module üòÖ. Lots of notes!

# Notes
These are notes & highlights taken during my study. Should be noted that some of these bullet points might be copy/pasted from the articles themselves. 

- Cycling processes : Removing CO2 for it to be feedstock for a product that emits it again after use (i.e: using captured CO2 to make fuels)
- Closed process : Removing CO2 for a feedstock with a high permance (i.e: Making concrete with captured CO2)
- CarbonTech refers to the industry centered around using captured carbon in other industrial processes (excluding enhanced oil recovery)

- Carbon can form four bonds with other atoms.

- Utilization could be a billio dollar industry by 2030.

- Mars has an atmosphere of 95% CO2.
    - Carbon conversion devices on Mars could produce building materials for 3D Printed tools & structures.

- Opus12 uses captured CO2 & some chemical engineering + catalysts to convert CO2 into 16 different molecules.
    - They're focused on commercializing three.
        - One of them is ethylene which is used for plastics.

- Captured CO2 can create polymers, the precursors for plastics, adhesives, & pharmaceuticals. 
    - Currently quite expensive to make

- Captured CO2 can accelerate the growth of algae 

- CO2 can be turned into various novel materials
    - Carbon composities, carbon fiber, graphene
    - C2CNT uses molten electrolysis to transform CO2 into carbon nanotubes

- Steel is the most commonly used metal in the world
    - Responsible for 7-9% global emissions

- Synthetic fuels according to this Vox article, have the best potential to scale up the quickest.

- CO2u: utilization of CO2
- CO2œÅ: reduction in CO2 emissions relative to baseline
- CO2r: removal of CO2 from the atmosphere
- CO2s: storage of CO2

- DOE‚Äôs Carbon Utilization Program houses the majority of 
federal research and development.

- Industries that use CO2 as a feedstock dont capture it onsite. It must be purchased from a market.

- Global scale of CO2u is just 180 Mt/yr in 2018. Which is just 0.8% of global emissions that year. 

- Life Cycle Analysis is really important in determing if a CO2u solution is actually neutral or negative. 

- Converting biomass to ethanol produces CO2 at a purity of 98% or even more. 

- Because of the strength of carbon-oxygen double bond, thermodynamics of chemical CO2 conversion are not great.

- Methanol is a flexible intermediate which can produce other chemicals.
    - It is also liquid at room temperature which in turn can be transported easily. 

- Conventional cement (e.g., ordinary Portland Cement) has a carbon intensity of about 850 kgCO2/t cement, most of which results from calcining limestone to produce clinker

- The scale of CDR required to make an impact on climate change ‚Äì 10 GtCO2/yr by midcentury and 20 GtCO2/yr by 2100.

- CarbonCure's approach seems very grounded in reality & many of the founders have pre-existing industry experience. This seems to be a common trend for the successful-ish companies highlighted by AirMiners. (Obviously makes sense, but shows the pragmatism being taken)
    - They follow the SaaS philosphy from big tech companies when retrofitting concrete plants. Don't try to reinvent the infra, use existing infra.
    - They've also entered the lobbying space which is crucial for this industry. Fossil Fuel lobbying is a powerful force in slowing down climate solutions. 

- Government procurement needs to be deployed to prefer sustainable solutions, which includes buying materials & products made via CO2u. 

- EOR could provide & help build a market for CO2u & CO2s. (Not too crazy about this but technically true)
    - Oil companies are putting a lot of funding in this space.
    - Still debate whether it is carbon negative or not.
    - US's 45Q Tax credit supports EOR.
    - Oil giants lobby against further regulation of EOR. They often don't use captured CO2.
    - Making EOR operations required to use captured CO2 could be a good start.
    - National LCFS (low carbon fuel standard) could also push innovation.

# Open Questions
- How can captured CO2 accelerate the growth of algae?
- Could we deploy "microcapture" facilites spread across the US & near plants that require a CO2 feedstock? Especially if these facilities could be mobile. Could help address concerns of transporting captured CO2. 
- How much does carbon capture & utilization play a role in the greenwashing of oil giants?
