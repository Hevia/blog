       "'Marine carbon dioxide (CO2) system data has been collected from December 2014 to June 2018 in the northern Salish Sea (NSS; British Columbia, Canada) and consisted of continuous measurements at two sites as well as spatially- and seasonally-distributed discrete seawater samples. The array of CO2 observing activities included high-resolution CO2 partial pressure (pCO2) and pHT (total scale) measurements made at the Hakai Institute’s Quadra Island Field Station (QIFS) and from an Environment Canada weather buoy, respectively, as well as discrete seawater measurements of pCO2 and total dissolved inorganic carbon (TCO2) obtained during a number of field campaigns. A relationship between NSS alkalinity and salinity was developed with the discrete datasets and used with the continuous measurements to highly resolve the marine CO2 system. Collectively, these datasets provided insights into the seasonality in this historically under-sampled region and detail the area’s tendency for aragonite saturation state () to be at non-corrosive levels (i.e. > 1) only in the upper water column during spring and summer months. This depth zone and time period of reprieve can be periodically interrupted by strong northwesterly winds that drive short-lived (~1 week) episodes of high-pCO2, low-pH, and low- conditions throughout the region. Interannual variability in summertime conditions was evident and linked to reduced northwesterly winds and increased stratification. Anthropogenic CO2 in NSS surface water was estimated using data from 2017 combined with the global atmospheric CO2 forcing for the period 1765 to 2100, and projected a mean value of 49 ± 5 µmol kg-1 for 2018. The estimated trend in anthropogenic CO2 was further used to assess the evolution of and pHT levels in NSS surface water, and revealed that wintertime corrosive conditions were likely absent pre-1900. The percent of the year spent above = 1 has dropped from ~98% in 1900 to ~60% by 2018. Over the coming decades, winter pHT and spring and summer are projected to decline to conditions below identified biological thresholds for select vulnerable species.'"

    "### ✨Preprocessing✨\n",
    "\n",
    "This is where your domain specific knowledge comes in. Do not be fooled with how easy this seems! This is a process that takes some time to get right. Tutorials can trick you with how easy this might seem, but alas that is not the case. \n",
    "\n",
    "We're working with scientific text, so let us consider the goals of this process:\n",
    "- We want to keep scientific terms, so avoid removing any rare or uncommon words.\n",
    "- Stopwords (the, we, and, etc) can safely be removed because their inclusion doesn't impact the meaning of our data. It also means less words for our model to be trained on.\n",
    "- Since authors can be inconsistent when captializing words (co2 vs CO2). Let's lowercase everything so the same words aren't treated differently.\n",
    "- The punctuation looked at me funny. So let's remove it because we don't need it.\n",
    "- I am from the future, so I know that after perfoming some of the operations above, we ended up with a lot of whitespace. Let's make sure to remove any extra!\n",

    "There are a few other ways we can improve this process, we won't show them in the tutorial, but here are some ideas:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Phrase Matching: Climate Change is treated as two separate words (climate & change), but we often think of this phrase as a single \"concept\". Most NLP methods define a word as a string of letters, separated by whitespace. This method won't work for all languages, but it also doesn't work for all domains. \n",
    "    - Linguistics also has another definition for a word as anything that encaptures a single semantic concept. \n",
    "        - So in our case: Climate Change or Sebastes ruberrimus (the scientific name for Yellow Rockfish). You can combine them into a single word for processing by replacing the space with a hyphen or concat them together:\n",
    "            - Climate change becomes climate-change or climateChange, etc\n",
    "\n",
    "- You can use a statistical tokenizer (like the ones used by Transformer models) along with minor cleaning to prepare your text. (Not sure *why* you would do this, but you could!)\n",
    "\n",
    "Text cleaning is also a never \"finished\" step. You can forever tinker here to better capture your domain in the embedding space. We're going to consider this good enough for now though 😉."
