This blog post is an overview of what I learned from Module 6 of Carbon Removal Academy while going through the AirMiners BootUp program. . Overview . Similar to DAC, I did not have the time this week to really dig into Mineralization. Many of the notes on geologic sequestration are similar to previous weeks though . Mineralization has a high permance capacity &amp; can be used in conjunction with DAC, but the downside is the lack of any end product from Mineralization (although there are attempts to address this) which can hinder its ability to bring costs per ton down. . Notes . These are notes &amp; highlights taken during my study. Should be noted that some of these bullet points might be copy/pasted from the articles themselves. . We have a LOT of geological storage capability as mentioned in DAC | Mineralization is a well understood process &amp; there is a lot of rock most of it (basalt) is underwater &amp; hard to reach | . | Long term site management is an issue.

Researchers at Princeton use two transformer language models to perform end-to-end relation extraction. (E2E-RE) Which involves identifying named entities in a text &amp; extracting important relational information between entities. . The code for this paper can be found here. . Why . Named Entity Recognition (NER) and Relation Extraction (RE) are two hugely important tasks in NLP. The applications of these techniques form the basis for a lot of modern technologies, and making these techniques more accessible can enable innovations in a lot more sectors. Relation extraction is one task I’ve seen neglected by many of the “accessible” AI frameworks. (That seems to be changing though) . How . Recent work in E2E-RE has involved passing an input text into a single model, and the model outputs the extracted relations. Prior to this paradigm researchers would use several models to accomplish this task. The authors of this paper propose a return to form. . They train two transformer language models. One known as the “entity model” to extract entities. The second known as the “relation model” to extract relations. The relation model’s input is provided by the entity model. This helps pass important entity information through the system. The tweek manages to keep the system simple and high performing. . Entity Model: . Builds on a span-level represntation. | pre-trained BERT | Takes an input sentence and predicts an entity type for each span. | . Relation Model: .

Keep it simple(?) | In the tradition of larger models being better, ALBERT implementations outperform smaller BERT models. | Models that specialize outperform generalists. | While some of the ideas used are not entirely new, the system as a whole is novel. | . Open Questions . How well does this approach scale to more jargon or technical domains? (i.e: biomedical, engineering) | . My perspective . This has many of the hallmarks of a great paper.

Overview . Bio-energy Carbon Capture &amp; Storage (BECCS) is the process of using biological product (plants, wood, etc) as an energy source &amp; storing the resulting CO2 underground. There are several byproducts produced during this process. Biochar which is a charcoal-like material that has a variety of applications. . I feel as if I finished this week not fully understanding the potential of BECCS. It started with being very skeptical of its ability to be scaled up equitably and finished feeling like “hmmm maybe it is a solution, at least in the US”. I still don’t know why or how BECCS is such an important solution for IPCC models. . Pros: . This could turn biowaste into a useful CDR tool. We produce a lot of biowaste too! | . | Biochar can improve soil health, and is easy to make. It can also be used as a input for a variety of fields: building, packaging materials, livestock feeds, filtration systems (probably my favorite usecase). | . | . Cons: . Fossil Fuel industry is a big fan of injecting carbon underground because it enables whats known as “enhanced oil recovery” | Growing crops exclusively for BECCS seems like a wasteful use of land. | Transporting biomass to an injection site costs its own set of emissions | Even when storing CO2 underground it still tries/wants to escape | . Notes . These are notes &amp; highlights taken during my study. Should be noted that some of these bullet points might be copy/pasted from the articles themselves. . BECCS involves growing plants, absorbing CO2 in the process, then converting the resulting biomass into energy. The carbon emissions are captured and buried underground, both removing CO2 the atmosphere and producing energy at the same time. . | Areas where large volumes of biomass can be grown and CO2 can be stored do not necessarily overlap. . | Research finds that there are enough suitable areas of the US to remove around 110m-120m tonnes (Mt) CO2 from the atmosphere by 2020 and 360-630MtCO2 by 2040. . | The US is of particular interest for the initial development and deployment of BECCS because it has relatively high biomass productivity and well-mapped geologic storage sites for CO2. The US also has a relatively mature bioenergy industry, as well as a number of pilot scale CO2 injection projects. . The US has a huge CO2 storage potential, with a total storage capacity estimated at around 3,000,000MtCO2. These storage sites are concentrated in the Southern, Northeastern, and Central Western parts of the country. | . | . Open Questions . Could coastal seedweed farming be a good source of biomass?

Forests are probably the OG rockstar of CDR. When I think of the early environmentalist movement, I think of folks protecting trees because they were the “lungs of the Earth”. Forests share many of the pros/cons of soil, with an upside being that forests are better at retaining the carbon they sequester. One resource I want to point out that I especially enjoyed was this podcast episode: Commoditizing Forest Carbon and Its Discontents—w/ Dr. Lauren Gifford . Pros: . Wood products are a way of storing CO2! I can’t believe this idea never clicked for me before. | We can genetically engineer trees to be better at absorbing CO2. | Forests provide other benefits such as natural spaces for a community &amp; protection of biodiversity. It is especially important we protect outdoor spaces. It isnt just the right thing to for other life on Earth, but so others can see what they’re protecting. | . | Forests don’t require a lot of technological resources to upkeep. A lot of measurements, reporting, &amp; verification have the potential to be updated. There are even startups that are helping with predicting/assessing risks forests face. Besides the occasional labor group for general management. Forests are a great low-tech (compared to others) CDR solution. | . Cons: . As climate change worsens, threats to forests increases. This weakens the permance that forests can provide. | . | Forests remove carbon on long timescales and require active management to protect. Forests are also threatened by socio-political factors like who controls the government. | . | Commodiziting forests feels gross, although not sure if we can ensure the widespread protection of nature without doing so. especially on privately owned land. | . | Forests don’t scale well, you need a lot of land that could be used for renewable energy production or farmland. | .

DeepMind trained Deep Generative Models on radar observations in the hopes of creating a model that can accurately model &amp; predict precipitation events within the immediate future (1-2 hours). . Why . Nowcasting (the act of predicting the weather in the next hour or so) is an extremely important task for a variety of fields.(Sports, transportation, news) Accurate weather predictions can improve safety, increase quality of life, and optimize logistical decisions. Current weather prediction systems have a long compute times &amp; struggle with accurate predictions within 2-hours from a given point in time. Machine Learning methods can fill in this gap and provide quick weather forecasts for the immediate future. . How . The GAN approach is used for their Deep Generative Models. The generator context is fed four consectuve radar observations | Two loss functions are used. The first loss function/spatial discriminator is a CNN that attempts to distinguish real radar observations from generated ones. | The second loss/temporal discriminator is a 3D CNN that attempts to distinguish real &amp; generated radar observations, but enforces a temporal consistency &amp; penalizes predictions that skip or jump forward in time. | . | . | The precipitation events are 256 x 256 crops extracted from the radar stream.

Over 89% ranked it as their preferred choice compared to existing methods. | More work is needed to improve accuracy on rare &amp; intense weather events | The model can generate predictions within seconds on just a NIVIDIA V100 GPU. | DeepMind’s work shows you do not need to encode physical assumptions about the weather to achive promising results. This is not news to ML practioners but more proof of a networks ability to model complex phenomena. | . Open Questions . Would a models performance improve if some assumptions/meterological knowledge was encoded? | If trained on radar observations from a variety of regions, would a models ability to predict improve? | . My perspective . This is my first time attempting to summarize a paper in this field. So I’ll save you my opinion until its informed by more papers &amp; model building experience.

Agricultural soil as a carbon removal solution is promising, but not without its drawbacks. . Pros: . Increases soil health metrics. (Soil Organic Carbon &amp; Soil Organic Matter) | Can be implemented (and is being implemented) today. | Increases crop yields. | Decreases fossil fuel consumption on farms. | Increase soils ability to capture &amp; store carbon. | Decrease reliance on fertilizers. | Protect &amp; ensure long term health of a farmers land. | Decrease soil erosion | Increase soil water levels. Making soil more drought tolerant. | . Cons: . Permance of the carbon sequestered is difficult to quantify and gains can be easily lost due to natural disasters. | Upfront costs are high and systems to compensate farms are not robustly or widely implemented. | Messaging &amp; educating farmers on benefits/adoption is a slow process. | Although not dicussed, big coporate interests might lobby to slow the transition &amp; discourage adoption. | Measuring the exact carbon sequestered is a difficult challenge at scale.

            "content": "Introduction 👋🏽 . Sustainable Software Engineering (SSE or SSWE) is a relatively young sub-field of the discipline it hearlds from. As the climate crisis worsens, and as our world relies on technology more &amp; more. It is important that we as engineers begin to consider the impact our software has on our planet. . While obvious ways of making your role more sustainable could be advocating for climate action at your workplace or joining a company that is working on solutions for the climate crisis, this post aims to cover some not so obvious ways you can bring sustainability to your role as a software engineer. . Carbon Proxies . Since it is often difficult to collect 100% accurate stats on the carbon footprint of your software. We can use other metrics to serve as a proxy that can link back to carbon emissions. . Here are a few examples of Carbon Proxies: . Frontend &amp; Client side Backend Services . Time to Interact (TTI). A shorter TTI implies better performing code | Server Costs or Compute Units. Aim to have your code just as well on lower end hardware. | . Page Size. Larger pages require more bandwidth | Utilization. Running a server 24/7 uses more energy then going serverless or allocating loads dynamically | . Carbon Aware vs Carbon Efficient . There are two terms often used to describe the role software plays in lowering emissions. These are not exclusive categories either. . Carbon Aware : Software that can change its behavior based on the current carbon intensity of the grid it is using​ . | Carbon Efficient : Efficient Software that can extract as much value as possible for carbon emitted​ . | . Majority of the time you are designing your applications to be carbon efficient, but increasingly there is an interest in application that are both carbon aware &amp; efficient. This post primarily covers ways to achieve the latter. . So what can developers do? 👩🏽‍💻 . This section will impart some common wisdom for those in various developer roles. I won’t be covering things like volunteering, “contribute to open source, or joining a climate tech company. Just action items you can implement in your day job. . One of the more important activites you can do as a developer is to be an advocate for change in your workplace. Work with other employees to demand your company have an ambitious climate comittment &amp; that it sticks to it. . One thing I will be omitting from this post is picking certain languages/technologies over others. Stick with what you are most productive in! But if you want to see how your choice of language could impact your carbon footprint. Check out this post on language choice &amp; desktop UI apps . If you think I missed something. Please feel free to contact me and let me know! .   . Web &amp; App Development 🌐 . Since this is the area I currently work in. I have a lot to say on the subject! So here is a nice listicle. . Some places you can measure the carbon footprint of your website: . Website Carbon | Greenspector | . Here is a non-exhaustive short list of ways you can reduce the environmental burden of your software: . Smaller JS bundles | Optimize for Core Web Vitals | Profile your applications to find weaknesses for optimization | Batch I/O calls over dozens of smaller calls | Lazy loading or virtualization | Use system default fonts | Subset your fonts, load only the glyphs you need | If your site requires CPU heavy loads from the client, consider using WASM for better performance | Ensure your website has a dark theme option (darker pixels use less energy) | Remove unnesscary cookies | .   . AI / ML 🧠 . The carbon footprint of training AI is an increasingly well known problem. While there are arguments to be made that we need larger models first before we can create smaller ones. If you are an engineer in space, try using a smaller model on your task before going straight for the largest one. Does it achieve similar performance? Does the larger model truly provide additional utility or revenue gains? . If you need to go with larger models, try to find infastructure powered completely by renewables. Most of the major cloud providers are already transitioning to renewable energy. You can search to see what regions run completely off of renewables. . For researchers, tools like ML CO2 Calculator can help you calculate the emissions from your model &amp; generate LaTeX for you to include in your publication. The Python package Code Carbon lets you track emissions of your model training with a few lines of code. . If you want to see applications of AI in the climate space. Checkout Microsoft’s AI for Earth program. .   . Cloud Computing, Operations &amp; Security ⛅ . As we defined carbon efficiency earlier. You always want your code to be as energy efficient as possible. Downtime or security vulnerabilities not only make your life as a developer more difficult, but also bring down how much value your code is using per unit energy consumed. . Infastructure &amp; system design decisions play a huge role here too! You can use chaos engineering to lower carbon emissions of your system or opt for serverless functions to reduce compute consumption. Moving past efficiency and into smarter systems such as Carbon-Aware Kubernetes or moving compute intensive workloads to data centers using renewable energy . If some of the above steps are a bit too extra for your workload, moving your infastructure over to containers alone can result in huge costs savings &amp; increased CPU utilization, both of these follow the principles of using less energy + getting more value out of the energy you do use. .   . Online Communities 💬 . Tons of amazing smart folks are also thinking about how software can help solve or mitigate the worse impacts of the climate crisis. Here are just a few communities where this awesome work is happening: . ClimateAction.tech | Work on Climate | Earthshot Labs | Climate Change AI | Important not Important | . Conclusion 🙋🏽‍♂️ . Thanks for reading! I wrote this post so I can share with friends some of the few dozen ways they we have an impact on the climate crisis. Being a software engineer, we often wonder the real world value or impact our code can have beyond business value. . The end goal of sustainable software engineering isn’t to establish a separate subdiscipline, but rather become part of what it means to be a software engineer. . Just as we consider performance, accessibility, testing, security, etc when writing our programs. We must now consider the impact our programs have on our environment. From the compute resources, to how it impacts the users on the other end. . References 📝 .

            "content": "Introduction 👋🏽 . This is a quick guide on how to deploy Explosion’s data annotation tool Prodigy. This guide is meant as a reference &amp; assumes you know how to use Docker, Azure, and you know how to deploy/provision a database. . If you get stuck check out the Prodigy docs or post your question on Prodigy’s support forum. . Prodigy Docker Container 🐳 . Here is a sample image that will spin up your Prodigy server when ran (this is the same one I use for deployments) . FROM python:stretch ENV PYTHONUNBUFFERED 1 ENV PRODIGY_PORT=8000 # This is important!!! Remember the port number for the Web App step ENV PRODIGY_LOGGING=verbose # I found the verbose logs helpful for debugging problems COPY *linux_x86_64.whl /root # This is your prodigy wheel thats given to you RUN pip install /root/prodigy*.whl RUN python -m spacy download en_core_web_md # Download the language embeddings you need RUN mkdir -p /root/.prodigy/ # store your config &amp; settings here COPY ProdigyLicenseKey.txt /root/.prodigy/ COPY prodigy.json /root/.prodigy/prodigy.json # Your prodigy settings COPY ./your_data.jsonl /root/ # Your data RUN pip install psycopg2 # Install your database ORM/driver here + any additional installs. We&#39;re using postgreSQL # Put your prodigy task ENTRYPOINT prodigy textcat.manual your_dataset_task_name ./root/your_data.jsonl --label your_labels_go_here . Prodigy.json 📚 . Here is an example of how your prodigy.json might look like. I had problems with Azure Web Apps when not setting &quot;host&quot;: &quot;0.0.0.0&quot;. Change db_settings to db of your choice, refer to Prodigy documentation for how to do so. . { &quot;feed_overlap&quot;: true, &quot;host&quot;: &quot;0.0.0.0&quot;, &quot;db&quot;: &quot;postgresql&quot;, &quot;db_settings&quot;: { &quot;postgresql&quot;: { &quot;host&quot;: &quot;yourdatabase.postgres.database.azure.com&quot;, &quot;dbname&quot;: &quot;postgres&quot;, &quot;user&quot;: &quot;admin-user@database-name&quot;, &quot;password&quot;: &quot;thepassword&quot; } } } . Deployment 🚀 . Prereqs ✅ . Dockerfile (like the one above) | Your database (deployed wherever it is) | prodigy.json (this should be inside your image) | . Database 📁 . Make sure you have your database configured beforehand. With prodigy you can have multiple instances running pointing to the same database working off of different datasets. You don’t need to spin up a new db with every image. Make sure your database accepts connections from the IP of your web app or the proper network permissions are in place. You will know your prodigy instance can connect to your database once you test it locally. . Docker 🐋 . You want to build &amp; test your prodigy image, then push it to your container registry. For this tutorial we’re using Docker’s public container registry. Might be best to use a private registery so nobody can pull your image and annotate your data 😅 . Build your prodigy: docker build -t &lt;tag-name&gt; . . | Test it locally: docker run -p 8000:8000 &lt;tag-name&gt; . | Push it to your container registry: docker push &lt;tag-name&gt; . | Azure Web Apps ⛅ .

            "title": "Concurrency & Parallelism with Python in 5 minutes",
            "content": "Introduction 🏃🏽‍♀️ . One of the best next steps you can take on your Python journey is diving into concurrency &amp; parallelsim. Many developers will often learn enough to get by, but you can spend your entire career in this space! There are a lot of exciting things to learn, but newcomers can often feel intimadated by the steep curve. In this series of short posts I am hoping we can distill these topics so you can start writing more performant Python 🚀🐍 . Concurrency vs Parallelism . When starting out in this space, these two terms can often cause some confusion. So let’s quickly define them: . Paradigm Definition . Concurrency | The process of interleaving unrelated tasks one at a time within bits of code (tasks being individual pieces of work i.e: adding together two numbers or sending a network request). | . Parallelism | Exectuing several or more bits of code at the same time. | .   . With Concurrency tasks do not need to occur one after the other, oftentime your progam will rapidly switch between the tasks. Giving the illusion that multiple things are occuring at the same time. . For a more descriptive analogy. You can think of parallelism as a grocery store with multiple checkout lanes. Customers (the code) don’t all have to use the same lane to have their goods processed. You can think of concurrency, as yourself! Maybe while you wait for your coffee to brew, you read the bird app, or while your code is building you go off and reply to emails . It should be noted that you can have concurrency &amp; parallelism at the same time. The terms are not mutually exclusive, however we will not be covering that in this post (You can explore this with the 2nd exercise of the Dive Deeper section) . Threads 🧵 . You can think of threads as the most basic block of where computation occurs. All your code is ran on a thread (which is inside of a process), and while it isnt threads all the way down. You don’t go any lower then this. . Quick example with threads: . import threading import time def thread_ripper_5000(num: int) -&gt; None: time.sleep(2) print(f&quot;Rip n Tear: {num}&quot;) a = threading.Thread(target=thread_ripper_5000, args=(1,)) b = threading.Thread(target=thread_ripper_5000, args=(2,)) threads = [a, b] for _thread in threads: _thread.start() # Have your thread start the computation for _thread in threads: _thread.join() # Have our threads wrap up work . Python has a unique feature that is pretty uncommon in most languages. Only one thread runs at a time…. Which leads us to the next section. . Oh My GIL 😱 . The reason only one thread can run at a time in Python is thanks to the Global Interpreter Lock (GIL, also recall Python is an interpretered hence the name). While many cite the GIL as the source of all their problems, working with multiple threads in large applications is hard. Writing multithreaded code introduces a whole new slew of bugs such as data races, deadlocking, &amp; heseinbugs. (However, it doesn’t fully protect you. We’ll explore this in later posts!) The GIL is saving your future self a lot of time. . So true multithreading is not really possible in Python, you can run multiple threads, but only one of them is ever actually doing anything at any given time. The rest idle by while its their time off the bench. However! You can still achieve parallel code execution, using processes! . If you want to learn more about the GIL, check out: Understanding the Python GIL by David Beazley   . Sidebar: What is a Lock? . A Lock is a quite literally what it means. It is an object that ensures only one thread can do X thing at a time.(It “locks” sections of code so nobody else can reach it) Locks go far beyond the GIL! If you want to ensure only one thread (hint hint this is a future post 😉) writes to a file or data structure at a time, you can use a lock! You’ll often hear locking referred to as Mutual Exclusion. . Processes 💿 . Every time you run Python it spawns its own process. The process handles state &amp; lots of other things you the programmer doesn’t need to worry about. As stated above each process comes with its own GIL. Plus with the multiprocessing library, you can spawn additional Python procceses in your code &amp; give them code to execute . import multiprocessing import time def process_ripper_5000(num: int) -&gt; None: time.sleep(2) print(f&quot;Process n Compute: {num}&quot;) a = multiprocessing.Process(target=process_ripper_5000, args=(1,)) b = multiprocessing.Process(target=process_ripper_5000, args=(2,)) processes = [a, b] for _process in processes: _process.start() # Have your process start the computation for _process in processes: _process.join() # Have our process wrap up work . A good read on writing multiproccessing code: Things I Wish They Told Me About Multiprocessing in Python . CPU vs IO workloads . To fully take advantage of the performance benefits that come with concurrent/parallel code. You need to know when to use what technique. Luckily figuring out isn’t too bad. Generally the advice for most situations goes like this: . For CPU workloads, you’ll want to use Parallelism/Processes  . | For IO workloads, you’ll want to use Concurrency/Threads . | . Workload Definition . CPU | Math, running methods on some data, physics simulation, running game AI/ML. | . IO | Reading/Writing data from disk, web apps, APIs, sending/reciving network data. | . Conclusion . This wraps up a brief introduction into the foundational vocabulary we’ll need for future posts. This might seem simple (and it is!). There is a whole LOT I didn’t mention or touch, but this introduction should aid in further or deeper dives into related subjects. . To review: . In any given Python process, only one thread can run at a time due to the Global Interprter Lock (GIL) | Threads are lightweight and a good choice for I/O workloads | Whenever you start a Python program it starts its own process with its own GIL. You can spawn additional processes which are a good way to speed up CPU workloads | . In later posts we’ll explore other topics such as concurrent.futures, asyncio, event loops, coroutines, getting past the GIL, and dive deeper into applications. . Diving Deeper . Besides checking out the references below, if you want to dive deeper into what was covered here, try these ideas: . Using the example from the Thread section, write some code that performs an I/O task such as getting weather data, reading/writing files, etc. | Try spawning several proccesses that also spawn several threads in their own processes! | Write a function that performs a mathematical sequence (Fibonacci is a popular one). Now write some code that runs the sequence using threads and another using processes. Which is faster? Why? | References .
