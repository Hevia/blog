            "content": "Introduction . This is a quick guide on how to deploy Explosion’s data annotation tool Prodigy. This guide is meant as a reference &amp; assumes you know how to use Docker, Azure, and you know how to deploy/provision a database. . If you get stuck check out the Prodigy docs or post your question on Prodigy’s support forum. . Prodigy Docker Container 🐳 . Here is a sample image that will spin up your Prodigy server when ran (this is the same one I use for deployments) . FROM python:stretch ENV PYTHONUNBUFFERED 1 ENV PRODIGY_PORT=8000 # This is important!!! Remember the port number for the Web App step ENV PRODIGY_LOGGING=verbose # I found the verbose logs helpful for debugging problems COPY *linux_x86_64.whl /root # This is your prodigy wheel thats given to you RUN pip install /root/prodigy*.whl RUN python -m spacy download en_core_web_md # Download the language embeddings you need RUN mkdir -p /root/.prodigy/ # store your config &amp; settings here COPY ProdigyLicenseKey.txt /root/.prodigy/ COPY prodigy.json /root/.prodigy/prodigy.json # Your prodigy settings COPY ./your_data.jsonl /root/ # Your data RUN pip install psycopg2 # Install your database ORM/driver here + any additional installs. We&#39;re using postgreSQL # Put your prodigy task ENTRYPOINT prodigy textcat.manual your_dataset_task_name ./root/your_data.jsonl --label your_labels_go_here . Prodigy.json ⚙ . Here is an example of how your prodigy.json might look like. I had problems with Azure Web Apps when not setting &quot;host&quot;: &quot;0.0.0.0&quot;. Change db_settings to db of your choice, refer to Prodigy documentation for how to do so. . { &quot;feed_overlap&quot;: true, &quot;host&quot;: &quot;0.0.0.0&quot;, &quot;db&quot;: &quot;postgresql&quot;, &quot;db_settings&quot;: { &quot;postgresql&quot;: { &quot;host&quot;: &quot;yourdatabase.postgres.database.azure.com&quot;, &quot;dbname&quot;: &quot;postgres&quot;, &quot;user&quot;: &quot;admin-user@database-name&quot;, &quot;password&quot;: &quot;thepassword&quot; } } } . Deployment . Prereqs . Dockerfile (like the one above) | Your database (deployed wherever it is) | prodigy.json (this should be inside your image) | . Database . Make sure you have your database configured beforehand. With prodigy you can have multiple instances running pointing to the same database working off of different datasets. You don’t need to spin up a new db with every image. Make sure your database accepts connections from the IP of your web app or the proper network permissions are in place. You will know your prodigy instance can connect to your database once you test it locally. . Docker . You want to build &amp; test your prodigy image, then push it to your container registry. For this tutorial we’re using Docker’s public container registry. Might be best to use a private registery so nobody can pull your image and annotate your data 😅 . Build your prodigy: docker build -t &lt;tag-name&gt; . . | Test it locally: docker run -p 8000:8000 &lt;tag-name&gt; . | Push it to your container registry: docker push &lt;tag-name&gt; . | Azure Web Apps . Navigate to the resource group you want to use. . Follow Add -&gt; Marketplace -&gt; Web App. . | On the Web App Creation Page under the Instance Details panel: Select Docker Container for Publish | Select Linux for OS | . | Configure everything else on this page for your needs. . | On the Web App Docker page, configure it to pull from your Docker image. Make sure you don’t have any accidental spaces or misspellings (which has happened plenty of times to myself!) . | Configure any other pages you need, but it is now good to hit Review + create . | Head over to your provisioned Web App resource . | On the left side column panel. Navigate to Settings -&gt; Configuration -&gt; Application Settings . | Add a new application setting . | Name it WEBSITES_PORT and set the value to be the same port number as the PRODIGY_PORT in your Dockerfile. So for example in our case WEBSITES_PORT would be set to 8000 . | Save &amp; restart your Web App | After some time, depending on the size of your container. You should be able to navigate to your URL &amp; start annotating! .",

            "title": "Concurrency & Parallelism with Python in 5 minutes",
            "content": "Introduction 🏃🏽‍♀️ . One of the best next steps you can take on your Python journey is diving into concurrency &amp; parallelsim. Many developers will often learn enough to get by, but you can spend your entire career in this space! There are a lot of exciting things to learn, but newcomers can often feel intimadated by the steep curve. In this series of short posts I am hoping we can distill these topics so you can start writing more performant Python 🚀🐍 . Concurrency vs Parallelism . When starting out in this space, these two terms can often cause some confusion. So let’s quickly define them: . Paradigm Definition . Concurrency | The process of interleaving unrelated tasks one at a time within bits of code (tasks being individual pieces of work i.e: adding together two numbers or sending a network request). | . Parallelism | Exectuing several or more bits of code at the same time. | .   . With Concurrency tasks do not need to occur one after the other, oftentime your progam will rapidly switch between the tasks. Giving the illusion that multiple things are occuring at the same time. . For a more descriptive analogy. You can think of parallelism as a grocery store with multiple checkout lanes. Customers (the code) don’t all have to use the same lane to have their goods processed. You can think of concurrency, as yourself! Maybe while you wait for your coffee to brew, you read the bird app, or while your code is building you go off and reply to emails . It should be noted that you can have concurrency &amp; parallelism at the same time. The terms are not mutually exclusive, however we will not be covering that in this post (You can explore this with the 2nd exercise of the Dive Deeper section) . Threads 🧵 . You can think of threads as the most basic block of where computation occurs. All your code is ran on a thread (which is inside of a process), and while it isnt threads all the way down. You don’t go any lower then this. . Quick example with threads: . import threading import time def thread_ripper_5000(num: int) -&gt; None: time.sleep(2) print(f&quot;Rip n Tear: {num}&quot;) a = threading.Thread(target=thread_ripper_5000, args=(1,)) b = threading.Thread(target=thread_ripper_5000, args=(2,)) threads = [a, b] for _thread in threads: _thread.start() # Have your thread start the computation for _thread in threads: _thread.join() # Have our threads wrap up work . Python has a unique feature that is pretty uncommon in most languages. Only one thread runs at a time…. Which leads us to the next section. . Oh My GIL 😱 . The reason only one thread can run at a time in Python is thanks to the Global Interpreter Lock (GIL, also recall Python is an interpretered hence the name). While many cite the GIL as the source of all their problems, working with multiple threads in large applications is hard. Writing multithreaded code introduces a whole new slew of bugs such as data races, deadlocking, &amp; heseinbugs. (However, it doesn’t fully protect you. We’ll explore this in later posts!) The GIL is saving your future self a lot of time. . So true multithreading is not really possible in Python, you can run multiple threads, but only one of them is ever actually doing anything at any given time. The rest idle by while its their time off the bench. However! You can still achieve parallel code execution, using processes! . If you want to learn more about the GIL, check out: Understanding the Python GIL by David Beazley   . Sidebar: What is a Lock? . A Lock is a quite literally what it means. It is an object that ensures only one thread can do X thing at a time.(It “locks” sections of code so nobody else can reach it) Locks go far beyond the GIL! If you want to ensure only one thread (hint hint this is a future post 😉) writes to a file or data structure at a time, you can use a lock! You’ll often hear locking referred to as Mutual Exclusion. . Processes 💿 . Every time you run Python it spawns its own process. The process handles state &amp; lots of other things you the programmer doesn’t need to worry about. As stated above each process comes with its own GIL. Plus with the multiprocessing library, you can spawn additional Python procceses in your code &amp; give them code to execute . import multiprocessing import time def process_ripper_5000(num: int) -&gt; None: time.sleep(2) print(f&quot;Process n Compute: {num}&quot;) a = multiprocessing.Process(target=process_ripper_5000, args=(1,)) b = multiprocessing.Process(target=process_ripper_5000, args=(2,)) processes = [a, b] for _process in processes: _process.start() # Have your process start the computation for _process in processes: _process.join() # Have our process wrap up work . A good read on writing multiproccessing code: Things I Wish They Told Me About Multiprocessing in Python . CPU vs IO workloads . To fully take advantage of the performance benefits that come with concurrent/parallel code. You need to know when to use what technique. Luckily figuring out isn’t too bad. Generally the advice for most situations goes like this: . For CPU workloads, you’ll want to use Parallelism/Processes  . | For IO workloads, you’ll want to use Concurrency/Threads . | . Workload Definition . CPU | Math, running methods on some data, physics simulation, running game AI/ML. | . IO | Reading/Writing data from disk, web apps, APIs, sending/reciving network data. | . Conclusion . This wraps up a brief introduction into the foundational vocabulary we’ll need for future posts. This might seem simple (and it is!). There is a whole LOT I didn’t mention or touch, but this introduction should aid in further or deeper dives into related subjects. . To review: . In any given Python process, only one thread can run at a time due to the Global Interprter Lock (GIL) | Threads are lightweight and a good choice for I/O workloads | Whenever you start a Python program it starts its own process with its own GIL. You can spawn additional processes which are a good way to speed up CPU workloads | . In later posts we’ll explore other topics such as concurrent.futures, asyncio, event loops, coroutines, getting past the GIL, and dive deeper into applications. . Diving Deeper . Besides checking out the references below, if you want to dive deeper into what was covered here, try these ideas: . Using the example from the Thread section, write some code that performs an I/O task such as getting weather data, reading/writing files, etc. | Try spawning several proccesses that also spawn several threads in their own processes! | Write a function that performs a mathematical sequence (Fibonacci is a popular one). Now write some code that runs the sequence using threads and another using processes. Which is faster? Why? | References .
