Python Concurrency: The Tricky Bits . The Python GIL only allows one thread to run at any given time | Because of the GIL, CPU bound tasks running on individual threads will slow each other down (theres a lot of blocking &amp; resource starvation) | Using threads does add additional speedups for I/O workloads | You can simulate non-cpu bound task in Python using time.sleep() | Python GIL will priotize CPU workloads over I/O workloads. This is unique to Python‚Äôs GIL since OS‚Äôs prefer shorter tasks | A thread is always contained in a process, and each process contains one or more threads. Threads in the same process can share memory which means they can easily communicate and write to common data structures. | Processes can generalize across CPU cores but threads can only run on a single core | A common workaround to running code in Parallel in Python is to spawn several processes | You can write C code that escapes the constraints of the GIL | Processes have a bigger overhead compared to threads due to shared data/program state | Procceses are not constrainted to run on a single CPU so you can execute CPU bound tasks in parallel on different cores | Do not use threads for CPU workloads and do not use Processes for IO workloads.
