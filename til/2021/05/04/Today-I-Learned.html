  <li>The Navajo goverment has its own presidental elections!</li>
  <li>Black on OLED screens is known to use less power because the LEDs that make up each pixel are off, whereas displaying white means the LEDs need to shine and consume power.</li>
  <li>Google found that on its devices that using blue used 25 percent more power than green or red</li>
  <li>In South Korea you are required by law to separate food scraps from your waste
    <ul>
      <li>That food waste is either turned into compost, biofuel, or other products</li>
      <li>rotting food is a significant source of methane</li>
      <li>It took 16 years from the laws inception in 1997 to finally achieve widespread adoption of 95%</li>
      <li>The volume of food waste is still extremely high, which means 20-30% of the recycled byproduct goes unused</li>
    </ul>

  <li>Cloudflare‚Äôs removal of the _cfduid cookie reports a net savings of 35k tons of CO2 per year because of Cloudflare‚Äôs operating scale</li>

  <li>‚ÄúBlue Carbon Storage‚Äù involves growing Kelp and sinking it to the seafloor to store carbon for nearly 1000 years</li>
  <li>Growing Sugar Kelp around Mussels helps improve the productivity of Mussels since Kelp can absord CO2 and reduce the local acidity levels</li>
  <li>Many marine plants evolved at a period in Earth‚Äôs climate where CO2 was 2-3x higher then current levels, so that is why they thrive in high CO2 waters</li>
  <li>Some macroalgaes produce carrageenan which is used as an emsulifier in various food systems</li>
  <li>You can use livestock wastewater + algae to reuse water or grow algae farms</li>

  <li>ServiceWorkers + CacheStorage is what helps lead to such huge performance gains</li>
  <li>You can invalidate an old service worker cache by adopting a new name</li>
  <li>The cache used by service workers is separate from the browser cache</li>

  <li>Service Workers are excuted in a ServiceWorkerGlobalScope context that have no access to DOM</li>
  <li>Service workers cannot be used when the user is in private browsing mode</li>
  <li>You have control over the cache lifetime for your site/service workers</li>
  <li>You can register service workers to listen for certain events (such as fetch) and whenever the client emits that event, the service workers will intercept the request &amp; perform the work. You can then cache the result</li>
  <li>You can have the client install new service workers by also updating the associated cache version</li>
  <li>ServiceWorkers also enable push notifications &amp; background sync APIs</li>

  <li>Thermal Desalination : Heat up water to remove</li>
  <li>Reverse Osmosis : Filter water through a membrane (but can be an inefficient proess)</li>
  <li>Desalination plants account for up to 76 million tons of CO2 a year</li>

  <li>Inside of Cacti fluid are sugars called mucilage which can bind with contaiminants in water &amp; help filter it. It was later developed into a powder which is used in many parts of the world to produce clean drinking water. Norma Alcantar is the scientists who discovered this after being told by her Grandmother how they would boil water with a cactus part a kids to help clean it.</li>
  <li><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shaken_baby_syndrome">Shaken Baby Syndrome</a></li>
  <li>In animal studies, a diet with 25% total calories coming from added sugars resulted in a 2-fold increase in total mortality rate</li>
  <li>Only use neutral oils when seasoning your cast iron (i.e: vegetabe, canola, sunflower, or shortening)</li>
  <li>10 passes through coarse &amp; 10 passes through fine are a good method to give your knives a quick sharp</li>
  <li>Don‚Äôt clean your wetstone until AFTER you are sharpening all your knives, it helps with sharpening</li>

<h2 id="python-concurrency-the-tricky-bits">Python Concurrency: The Tricky Bits</h2>

<ul>
  <li>The Python GIL only allows one thread to run at any given time</li>
  <li>Because of the GIL, CPU bound tasks running on individual threads will slow each other down (theres a lot of blocking &amp; resource starvation)</li>
  <li>Using threads does add additional speedups for I/O workloads</li>
  <li>You can simulate non-cpu bound task in Python using time.sleep()</li>
  <li>Python GIL will priotize CPU workloads over I/O workloads. This is unique to Python‚Äôs GIL since OS‚Äôs prefer shorter tasks</li>
  <li>A thread is always contained in a process, and each process contains one or more threads. Threads in the same process can share memory which means they can easily communicate and write to common data structures.</li>
  <li>Processes can generalize across CPU cores but threads can only run on a single core</li>
  <li>A common workaround to running code in Parallel in Python is to spawn several processes</li>
  <li>You can write C code that escapes the constraints of the GIL</li>
  <li>Processes have a bigger overhead compared to threads due to shared data/program state</li>
  <li>Procceses are not constrainted to run on a single CPU so you can execute CPU bound tasks in parallel on different cores</li>
  <li>Do not use threads for CPU workloads and do not use Processes for IO workloads. You will see decreased performance</li>
  <li>Reading/writing data to disk is not CPU work its IO work!</li>
  <li>Threads are more memory efficient then processes</li>
  <li>Pre-Emptive Multitasking is when the OS automately switches &amp; interleaves thread events for you</li>
  <li>Cooperative Multitasking is when each thread announces when they want to switch. You can use coroutines to achieve this</li>
